Description: Sampling CPU and HEAP profiler for Java
 async-profiler is a low overhead sampling profiler for Java that does not
 suffer from the safepoint bias problem. It features HotSpot-specific APIs
 to collect stack traces and to track memory allocations. The profiler works
 with OpenJDK, Oracle JDK, and other Java runtimes based on the HotSpot JVM.
 .
 Supported profiling modes include CPU, wall-clock, allocation, and lock
 profiling, with output in flame graph, JFR, and other formats.
